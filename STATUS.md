## Done

- Baseline: Copilot vs maintainer inline review comments on the 40 shared PRs, with hand labels
  (`labels.json`, `copilot_labels.json`) and the analysis scripts.
- Held-out set of 8 `tool`-scope PRs frozen before any guidance was written (`heldout.json`).
- Evaluation plan fixed before any held-out replay (`PREREGISTRATION.md`).
- Replay tooling (`replay.py`) with a dry-run default, token redaction and a `--prs` filter.

## Pending

- The held-out replay needs GitHub Copilot code review enabled on the account that owns the
  sandbox repo. Pilot sandbox PRs exist for 1362 (baseline and guided, one run each) but have
  no Copilot review yet.
- Until Copilot access is available, the guidance in the upstream PR is judged on the baseline
  data only; no claim is made about its effect.

## If the replay has to be reduced

A single run per condition (16 reviews instead of 32) is the smallest change that keeps the
design. It would be recorded here as a deviation from `PREREGISTRATION.md`, not applied
silently, and the decision rule would stay as written.
